# Ideamagix Review Test Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a test assignment for Ideamagix to demonstrate my skills in front-end web development. The task was to replicate a given design mockup into a responsive webpage using modern web technologies. The webpage includes a fixed-position form, a scrollable background, image lazy loading, and a carousel using Owl Carousel.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: For interactivity, including the mobile menu functionality.
- **Owl Carousel**: For creating a responsive slider.
- **Lazy Load**: To optimize image loading and improve page performance.
- **Page Loader**: A preloader to cover the entire screen until the page is fully loaded.

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The page adjusts seamlessly across devices, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
2. **Owl Carousel Slider**: Implemented for dynamic image sliders, enhancing user interaction.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded only when they come into the viewport, reducing initial load times.
4. **Fixed Form Placement**: The form remains fixed in place, while the background section scrolls.
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The page is tested and functional across modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Edge.
6. **Mobile Menu**: The menu is optimized for mobile devices, using JavaScript/jQuery for functionality.
7. **Page Loader**: A full-screen loader that fades away once the content is fully loaded.
